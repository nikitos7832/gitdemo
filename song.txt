Who really knows what rights all the wrongs anyway?
Who really cares what people do or say?
No matter where this life takes me
I'll never let it compromise
Too much luck to bet it on do or die

Cuz I've seen everything that I could see
And now I can say goodbye today
With all I know
It's time I said goodbye
Today is a good day to die
